# Understanding Happiness

**All code is my own.**

But comments like `this`, are my professor's words. They guided me through the first part. Normal text I wrote myself.

`In this assignment I will explore happiness in the US using the General Social Survey, a database of survey results conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago from 1972 to present. The main research question here is: what makes people happy? Or, more specifically, what activities or life choices are most clearly correlated with self-reported happiness. And, over a long period of time, how have these trends changed.`

That is the introduction provided to me from my professor. But in my own words: 

In this notebook I first analyze data and attempt to find the answer to questions provided by my professor. Then, I pose my own hypotheses and test them.
